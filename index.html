	<p><h1>The CU Catacombs</h1></p>
	
	<p>There once was a CU student named Camilla, who loved to run. She ran all around CU's campus and Boulder. She loved the adrenaline, the feeling of her muscles working hard, and she especially loved when her lungs were full of dry Colorado air.</p>
	<p>One day as Camilla was running toward the Engineering Center, she noticed a small rabbit. She was suddenly reminded of her childhood pet, Attila the Bun, who had taught her to jump and led her to first join track and field in middle school. As this was happening, Camilla had failed to notice a gapping hole right in front of her. </p>
	<p>Before she could catch herself, Camilla was falling into the pitch black hole. After a few seconds of falling, she finally landed on the wet ground. There was a chill in the air and she could hear dripping water. She looked around but couldn't see anything so she turned on the flashlight on her phone. She was shocked with what she saw. Right in front of her was a skull.</p>
	<p>Camilla's scream echoed. She looked around and realized that it wasn't just a skull, but she was surrounded by thousands of human bones. She started to realize what this strange place she fell into was. She was in a catacomb underneath CU. Camilla fearfully started looking around for a way out of this terrifying place. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be an obvious way out. Even the hole that she fell through was hopeless, as it was too high for her to reach. She sat down, defeated, thinking of Attila the Bun to calm her nerves.</p>
	<p>She reasoned that she couldn't stay here forever. She shivered, feeling goosebumps raise along her skin. It's damp, cold, and extremely creepy. She doesn't know if she'll ever get out of here. Camilla looked up at the hole she fell through; there's not a place to climb out, so she'll have to find another way.</p>
	<p>Looking around the hall, there wasn't much else other than skulls. So she picked a random direction and started walking. Her steps echoed in the quiet chamber, and she wondered whether anyone else was down here. It was then that she heard sounds behind her...like footsteps.</p>
	<p>As she slowly turned around, the light from her phone's flashlight swept over the bones of deceased Buffs plastered on the walls. (It was obvious that the archaeology and art departs had collaborated on this secret project.) Excepting to see a person and their shadow when she pointed the light in the direction she came from, there was nothing... UNTIL, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted the bunny. It had evidently followed her into the hole where she first fell. For a minute there, Camilla felt like she was in a morbid version of Alice in Wonderland.</p>
	<p>"LOW BATTERY - 20% battery remaining" flashed across Camilla's phone screen. Her anxiety started to kick in as she realized there's a chance she might get trapped in the CU Catacombs without any light or way out. She frantically tried to make a call with no success. It was just her and the Maze Bunner, the name she had decided to call her new friend. After losing another 2% of her battery from the phone call, she took a deep breathe and continued on through the tunnels with Maze Bunner following in her footsteps.</p>
