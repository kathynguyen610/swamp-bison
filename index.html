	<p><h1>The CU Catacombs</h1></p>
	
	<p>There once was a CU student named Camilla, who loved to run. She ran all around CU's campus and Boulder. She loved the adrenaline, the feeling of her muscles working hard, and she especially loved when her lungs were full of dry Colorado air.</p>
	<p>One day as Camilla was running toward the Engineering Center, she noticed a small rabbit. She was suddenly reminded of her childhood pet, Attila the Bun, who had taught her to jump and led her to first join track and field in middle school. As this was happening, Camilla had failed to notice a gapping hole right in front of her. </p>
	<p>Before she could catch herself, Camilla was falling into the pitch black hole. After a few seconds of falling, she finally landed on the wet ground. There was a chill in the air and she could hear dripping water. She looked around but couldn't see anything so she turned on the flashlight on her phone. She was shocked with what she saw. Right in front of her was a skull.</p>
	<p>Camilla's scream echoed. She looked around and realized that it wasn't just a skull, but she was surrounded by thousands of human bones. She started to realize what this strange place she fell into was. She was in a catacomb underneath CU. Camilla fearfully started looking around for a way out of this terrifying place. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be an obvious way out. Even the hole that she fell through was hopeless, as it was too high for her to reach. She sat down, defeated, thinking of Attila the Bun to calm her nerves.</p>
