		<h1>The CU Catacombs</h1>

	<div class = "paragraph">
		<p>There once was a CU student named Camilla, who loved to run. She ran all around CU's campus and Boulder. She loved the adrenaline, the feeling of her muscles working hard, and she especially loved when her lungs were full of dry Colorado air.</p>
		<p>One day as Camilla was running toward the Engineering Center, she noticed a small rabbit. She was suddenly reminded of her childhood pet, Attila the Bun, who had taught her to jump and led her to first join track and field in middle school. As this was happening, Camilla had failed to notice a gaping hole right in front of her. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "parallax3">
		<p>Before she could catch herself, Camilla was falling into the pitch black hole. After a few seconds of falling, she finally landed on the wet ground. There was a chill in the air and she could hear dripping water. She looked around but couldn't see anything so she turned on the flashlight on her phone. She was shocked with what she saw. Right in front of her was a skull.</p>
		<p>Camilla's scream echoed. She looked around and realized that it wasn't just a skull, but she was surrounded by thousands of human bones. She started to realize what this strange place she fell into was. She was in a catacomb underneath CU. Camilla fearfully started looking around for a way out of this terrifying place. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be an obvious way out. Even the hole that she fell through was hopeless, as it was too high for her to reach. She sat down, defeated, thinking of Attila the Bun to calm her nerves.</p>

	<div class = "parallax4">
		<p>She reasoned that she couldn't stay here forever. She shivered, feeling goosebumps raise along her skin. It's damp, cold, and extremely creepy. She doesn't know if she'll ever get out of here. Camilla looked up at the hole she fell through; there's not a place to climb out, so she'll have to find another way.</p>
		<p>Looking around the hall, there wasn't much else other than skulls. So she picked a random direction and started walking. Her steps echoed in the quiet chamber, and she wondered whether anyone else was down here. It was then that she heard sounds behind her...like footsteps.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class = "parallax5">
		<p>Camilla slowly turned around, but before she could see what was behind her it was gone. It was almost as if there was a paranormal presence in the tunnels with her. Something didn't feel right and she needed to get out of there as soon as she could.</p>

		<p>She kept walking and the air was dusty so it was hard to see. Suddenly she stumbles over a wire and falls into a trap door.</p>

		<p>As she slowly turned around, the light from her phone's flashlight swept over the bones of deceased Buffs plastered on the walls. (It was obvious that the archaeology and art departs had collaborated on this secret project.) Expecting to see a person and their shadow when she pointed the light in the direction she came from, there was nothing... UNTIL, out of the corner of her eye, she spotted the bunny. It had evidently followed her into the hole where she first fell. For a minute there, Camilla felt like she was in a morbid version of Alice in Wonderland.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>"LOW BATTERY - 20% battery remaining" flashed across Camilla's phone screen. Her anxiety started to kick in as she realized there's a chance she might get trapped in the CU Catacombs without any light or way out. She frantically tried to make a call with no success. It was just her and the Maze Bunner, the name she had decided to call her new friend. After losing another 2% of her battery from the phone call, she took a deep breathe and continued on through the tunnels with Maze Bunner following in her footsteps.</p>
		<p>In an effort to save her phone battery, she turned off her flashlight and decided to let her eyes try to adjust to the dark. Soon enough she could see pretty well without the help of the light. But after wandering for hours, she started to get hopeless and her stomach started growling. She sat down and leaned against the wall, defeated.</p>

	</div>

	<div class = "parallax6">
		<p>Out of nowhere, Maze Bunner started acting strangely. He hopped on Camilla's lap and started nudging her with his nose. His ears were layed back showing that there was something he was scared of. It almost seemed as if he was trying to tell Camilla something. Seeing Maze Bunner act this way started to make Camilla feel a little nervous. All of the sudden, Maze Bunner jumped out of her lap and started running really fast down the tunnel. Not wanting to lose the only companion she had in this tunnel, and also fearful of what the rabbit was running from, Camilla didn't hesitate to follow Maze Bunner. </p>
		<p>The Maze Bunner was really fast, she could barely keep up with him! He dashed around a dimly lit corner. She nearly ran into the wall of bones before she slid to a stop. There's a wooden door, and she could see light shining underneath. Reluctantly, she raised a hand and knocked on the door. "Hello?" She asked, before it swung open.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "paragraph">
		<p>It was a classroom. There were chairs pushed up against the walls, and she saw people turned away from her, gathered around a makeshift fire and saying strange words. The brightly colored hair and paint stained clothes...she could recognize those anywhere! It's the art students! She screamed and ran down the hall, gathering their attention.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "parallax7">
		<p>The art students were startled and went to check out what was going on in the hall. Camilla and Maze Bunner nearly took out the art students becasue they wanted to get back home so badly. After the art students calmed her down she made her way back home.</p>
		<p>After finally making it home Camilla and Maze Bunner never wanted to leave their house again. What an unexpected adventure they had. After camling down Camilla realized she had left her phone down there... Will she return to find it?</p>
